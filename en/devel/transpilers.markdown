JavaScript transpilers (or transcompilers) are tools that convert a specific language code into ES JavaScript. It takes
the source code of a program written in one programming language as its input and produces the equivalent source code in
another programming language.

Clarive supports using transpilers to filter and preprocess JS code before being executed.  Clarive also ships with
a few transpilers pre-installed:

- Babel (ES2015)
- TypeScript

## Using Transpilers

To have your code processed through one of the installed transpilers use a special JavaScript pragma created for this.

The pragma to activate transpiling is this:

```js
    "use transpiler([transpiler name])";
```

This will have the __full current body of source code__ transpiled, independently of where the pragma is declared.

Notice that althought transpiling is not a very expensive operation, everytime new unique source code is created, it has
to be transpiled, which means loading the transpiler, parsing and converting to JavaScript. Clarive caches the
transpiled code, so the next execution will only cost the same as if it were written in plain JavaScript, which can mean
a 100x or more improvement in execution speed.

If you believe you're having issues with transpiled code cached, try wiping the cache to force it to be transpiled
again.

## Babel

Babel allows you to use the latest developments in the EcmaScript standard (ie. ES6) in the Clarive JS VM, which
conforms up to ES5.

```javascript
"use transpiler(babel)";

// Expression bodies
evens = [2,4,6,8]
var odds = evens.map(v => v + 1);
var nums = evens.map((v, i) => v + i);

// Interpolate variable bindings
var name = "Bob", time = "today";
print(`Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`);

class Animal {
    constructor(name, voice) {
        this.name = name;
        this.voice = voice;

        this._eyes = 2;
    }
    get eyes() {
        return this._eyes;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`The ${this.name} says ${this.voice}.`);
    }
}

var foo = new Animal('dog', 'woof');
foo.speak(); // The dog says woof.
```

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented
programming to the language

```typescript
"use transpiler(typescript)";

class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
print( greeter.greet() );
```

## Creating Transpilers

Transpilers can be created as part of a plugin, by adding a special procesor anonymous function to the
`[plugin]/transpiler/` folder.

For creating a transpiler from a standard transpiler library, it is recommended you install first the library in
`[plugin]/modules/`, then write a lightweight transpiler that `require()`s the library.

This is the transpiler procesor skelleton, ie `[plugin]/transpiler/mytranspiler.js`:

```js
module.exports = function(code){
    var tr = require('../transpiler/mytranspiler-lib.js');
    return tr.transpile(code);
};
```

The anonymous function receives `code` as an argument, which is the full body of the pre-transpiled code.

The function must return a string with the transpiled code.

Now, we can use it in our Clarive JS DSL:

```js
"use transpiler(mytranspiler)";

// .. my pre-transpiled code ..

```
