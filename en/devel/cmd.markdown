It's posible to write programs that extend the `cla` command with new functionality and leverages on the Clarive
Platform for accessing agents, configuration items, and other functionality.

    cla mycommand --myoptions

## Getting started

By running the `cla` command, the list of available commands are listed.

Adding new commands is done from within a plugin.

To create a new plugin, in case you don't have one already, run the `plugin-bootstrap` command:

    cla plugin-new --plugin myplugin

Now create a command file, let's say we want to create the `mycmd` command, this would be the appropriate file:

    CLARIVE_BASE/plugins/myplugin/cmd/mycmd.js

A command program is just a plain JS program:

```javascript
print("Hello World");
```

### Full command configuration

Although command-line options are available, the correct way to access the command configuration is by calling
`process.options(key)`, which retrieves the correct configuration value from a merged, comprehensive object, which
includes:

- the global config YAML file
- the config YAML file (set with `-c`)
- the command section within the configuration file
- finally, the command line argument flags

Precedence goes from bottom to top.

The `process.options(key)` function accesses the merged
options stack.

    print( process.options('mongo.db_name') );

### Command Arguments

The command-line arguments is sent to the program through the `process` variable:

    console.log( process.argv() );

You can also access the individual options as an object, which is actually much easier to manipulate than going though
the `argv` array.

```javascript
var myoption = process.args('myoption');
print( "User entered --myoption=" + myoption );
```
