JavaScript is the language of choice for writing automation rules code in Clarive.

JavaScript, shorted as JS in many places, is the perfect language for such task, as its syntax is simple and universally
known and understood. Everyday new libraries, both client and server alike, are being implemented to extend the language
and diversify its reach and approach.

JavaScript has the following attractive features:

- simple-yet-powerful data structures
- fast interpreter
- widely adopted, which translates into many tools and resources available from the internet to enable development

Additionally, the implementation of JavaScript in Clarive adds the following:

- a threading model, for writing concurrent tasks
- template literals, for multi-line strings with flexible and powerful templating
- heredocs, also for multi-line strings but without iterpolation for `${...}` variables
- an embedded module loading system (`require`) that enables you to leverage the power of opensource and commercial
  extensions.

### Why do I need to write JavaScript in rules?

Sometimes using palette operations in rules is not enough. Complexities of data manipulation and other processing may be
required by your automation workflow. For example:

- extracting a substring out of text entered into a topic field
- writing to a file in the filesystem
- analyzing the different relationships among topics in a release
- etc.

That's when JavaScript comes in. Using rule Server Code operations enables Clarive administrators to develop new
functionality that expands the usability of the automation rules to the next level.

### JavaScript API in Clarive

Clarive's JavaScript API is built as an extension to the language through the singleton object `Cla`.

The API is robust and allows developers to use the following library areas:

- Filesystem
- Mongo Database access
- Resources, with access to data, relationships and class methods
- Clarive security (user, roles, etc)
- Events, semaphores and other system control utilities which are handy for automation
- Generic utilities for data manipulation, including a powerful regular expression engine
- Unicode suppport
- and much more!

### Version of JavaScript implemented in Clarive

The current JavaScript interpreter is based on the [Duktape <img class='ext-link'
src='/static/images/icons/window-new.svg' />](http://duktape.org) embedded interpreter engine, which is [Ecmascript
v5/v5.1 compliant <img class='ext-link' src='/static/images/icons/window-new.svg'
/>](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/), although some Ecmascript v6 features are also available:

List of Ecmascript v6 features supported by Duktape is available [here <img class='ext-link'
