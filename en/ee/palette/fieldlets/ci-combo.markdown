### Advanced filter JSON

Allows to use a JSON format to add a condition.

        {"name":"Project_name"}
        {"moniker":"Moniker_of_the_project"}


Selectable fields to filter can be found through the REPL. In this case the command would be: `CI-> project-> find_one
();`

It is also possible to apply date intervals to limit results. To use this, is necessary to make use of the commands *lt*
and *gt* own by MongoDB.

- **Role selection** - Select the role to be displayed on the form, regardless of class. For example, if we choose
  Agent, in the form we will see all Agents, *ftp_agent*, *clax_agent*, etc...
