The DO-WHILE control operation interates a code block while the condition indicated is true.

A DO-WHILE block executes the code first, then checks if the condition is true. If you need the opposite, first the
condition, then the code, take a look at [WHILE](/ee/palette/control/while).

For the configuration options, [take a look at the WHILE operation](/ee/palette/control/while).
