Iterates over the nested ops so many times as indicated in a list; sets the stash value defined to each element of the
list in turn.

Conceptually, this iterative `for` is the same as you can find in any programming language.

Form to configure has the following fields:

- **Stash Variable** - Variable name that is set to each element of the list in turn.
- **Code** - Text area to be filled with the list to iterate over the nested ops.
