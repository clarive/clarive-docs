Labels are useful for identifying topics quickly. In the topic grid it is possible to filter by tags, or add an
additional column to be able to sort topics based on the priority of the tags.

Labels administration is located within Admin - ![](/static/images/icons/label.svg) Labels.

You can define the following parameters:

- `Name` - Text box to set label name.
- `Color` - Pick a color to identify the label.
- `Priority` - Priority of the label. When the value is higher, the label has more priority.
