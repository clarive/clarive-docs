## Automation Server

Clarive has at least one automation server. This server is responsible for the following tasks:

- Planning and execution of jobs and integration with schedulers.
- Build management and deployment. Communication with agents.
- Batch processes, such as purging or backup.
- Integration with external tools: Source code management, Incident management, cmdb, etc.
- Export and Import of data.

## Web Server

The primary user interface of Clarive is Web-based.

Clarive features an application server that provides the web interface of Clarive and the SOAP and REST WebServices. The
web server is based on the Catalyst framework and runs standalone or under compatible servers like Apache, Nginx or
Lighttpd.

## Web Client

Clarive Web client uses the latest Web 2.0 technology to deliver a dynamic and natural user experience, similar to that
of a client application, but from any system on the network.

## Agents

Realising the process of building and deploying applications, Clarive needs to communicate with servers on the network:
with proprietary agents or via SSH.

Clarive agents are compatible with any UNIX, Linux or Windows technology.

## Interfaces

The product includes the following interfaces for customization and integration within the company.

- Web-services SOAP and REST
- Command line
- JavaScript DSL and API for the implementation of plugins and automation logic

### Authentication and authorisation

The user can authenticate to Clarive using the most common standards in the company:

- LDAP, Active Directory
- Proprietary Authentication
- Integration with external authentication and authorization SSO (Single Sign-On), such as BMC Atrium, CAS, SAML, by
  use key generation.

Through the tool's API the load of users and granting permissions to roles, groups and applications can be handled.

# System Requirements

Clarive requires a server with 64-bit processor. The machine can be virtualized or not. Other requirements depend on
machine usage requirements, measured considering the following variables:

- Number of users
- Size of the application
- Version freqeuncy of the application
- Number of daily deployments
