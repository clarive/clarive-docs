## Recommendations

As highlighted in the architecture considerations document, we recommend MongoDB to be installed in a separate machine
from the Clarive Server, as that helps improve overall performance and better share the available resources in between
machines.

## Installation

The steps needed to install MongoDB are:

- Download the archive for your operating system
- Untar/uncompress files and move them to their definitive location
- Edit the configuration file
- Start the database

### Download

First, download the MongoDB installation binaries for your operating system from the following locations:

## Mongo Server Configuration

To configure MongoDB, open the `mongod.conf` file located in your `CLARIVE_BASE/config` directory.

This file contains the standard product configuration, please do not change any parameters not mentioned in this
documentation as that may void your service/maintenance contract or unless requested by your Clarive Support
Representative.

Contents of the `mongod.conf` file:

```yaml
dbpath=/opt/clarive/data/mongo
logpath=/opt/clarive/logs/mongod.log
pidfilepath=/opt/clarive/logs/mongod.pid
fork=true
bindIp=127.0.0.1
port=27017
logappend=true
setParameter=failIndexKeyTooLong=false
storageEngine=wiredTiger
```

### `bindIp`

This is the IP address the MongoDB database daemon will listen for incoming connections. If this is a MongoDB instance
that has been installed exclusively for use with Clarive, either:

- **Do not** bind to IP addresses that are accessible by your corporate network or the internet at large! If possible,
  choose an IP address that is only available at the cluster level.
- Setup a firewall that limits access to the Mongo Server

### `port`

The port is the network port the Mongo database daemon listens for connections from the Clarive Server.

Remember, if you change the port here, you need to modify the Clarive Server configuration file port.

### `dbpath`

This is the path to the directory where the Mongo database files will reside.

The files in this directory can require extensive disk space as your Clarive usage grows. Disk use and file sizes depend
highly on system usage, number of jobs, artifacts generated and other factors, but can reach many GB quickly.

Please plan accordingly as lack of database disk space **may disrupt Clarive Server service and could cause severe data
loss**.

By default, this value is set to `CLARIVE_BASE/data/mongo`.

### `logpath`

This is the path to the directory where all Mongo log files are stored.

Plan for moderate space requirements, typically around 1GB.

### `pidfilepath`

Path to the file that indicates if the database is started or not.

You may change this to any location on the server to fit your installation needs, but we recommend setting it to either
the `CLARIVE_BASE/logs/` or `CLARIVE_HOME/data/` directories.

## Clarive Mongo Configuration

Here are the Clarive `[env].yml` file configuration entries that control the connection from Clarive to MongoDB.

```yaml
mongo:
    dbname: acmebank
    retry_frequency: 5
    max_retries: 60
    client:
        host: 'localhost:27017'
        username: myuser
        password: mypassword
        auto_reconnect: 1
        query_timeout: -1
        #auto_connect: 1
        #host: 'mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost2:27018'
        #w
        #wtimeout
        #j
        #timeout: 20000
        #db_name
        #max_bson_size
        #find_master: 1
        #ssl
        #sasl
        #sasl_mechanism
        #dt_type
        #inflate_dbrefs: 1
```

Options:

#### `dbname`

The database name.

#### `host`

The host attribute specifies either a single server to connect to (as hostname or hostname:port), or else a connection
string URI with a seed list of one or more servers plus connection options.

Defaults to the connection string URI mongodb://localhost:27017.

#### `auth_mechanism`

This attribute determines how the client authenticates with the server. Valid values are:

    NONE
    DEFAULT
    MONGODB-CR
    MONGODB-X509
    GSSAPI
    PLAIN
    SCRAM-SHA-1

If not specified, then if no username is provided, it defaults to NONE. If a username is provided, it is set to DEFAULT,
which chooses SCRAM-SHA-1 if available or MONGODB-CR otherwise.

This may be set in a connection string with the authMechanism option.

#### `auth_mechanism_properties`

This is an optional hash reference of authentication mechanism specific properties. See "AUTHENTICATION" for details.

This may be set in a connection string with the authMechanismProperties option.  If given, the value must be key/value
pairs joined with a ":". Multiple pairs must be separated by a comma. If ": or "," appear in a key or value, they must
be URL encoded.

#### `connect_timeout_ms`

This attribute specifies the amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a new connection to a server.

The default is 10,000 ms.

If set to a negative value, connection operations will block indefinitely until the server replies or until the
operating system TCP/IP stack gives up (e.g. if the name can't resolve or there is no process listening on the target
host/port).

A zero value polls the socket during connection and is thus likely to fail except when talking to a local process (and
perhaps even then).

This may be set in a connection string with the connectTimeoutMS option.

#### `db_name`

Optional. If an "auth_mechanism" requires a database for authentication, this attribute will be used. Otherwise, it will
be ignored. Defaults to "admin".

This may be provided in the connection string URI as a path between the authority and option parameter sections. For
example, to authenticate against the "admin" database (showing a configuration option only for illustration):

    mongodb://localhost/admin?readPreference=primary

#### `heartbeat_frequency_ms`

The time in milliseconds (non-negative) between scans of all servers to check if they are up and update their latency.
Defaults to 60,000 ms.

This may be set in a connection string with the heartbeatFrequencyMS option.

#### `j`

If true, the client will block until write operations have been committed to the server's journal. Prior to MongoDB 2.6,
this option was ignored if the server was running without journaling. Starting with MongoDB 2.6, write operations will
fail if this option is used when the server is running without journaling.

This may be set in a connection string with the journal option as the strings 'true' or 'false'.

#### `local_threshold_ms`

The width of the 'latency window': when choosing between multiple suitable servers for an operation, the acceptable
delta in milliseconds (non-negative) between shortest and longest average round-trip times. Servers within the latency
window are selected randomly.

Set this to "0" to always select the server with the shortest average round trip time. Set this to a very high value to
always randomly choose any known server.

Defaults to 15 ms.

This may be set in a connection string with the localThresholdMS option.

#### `max_time_ms`

Specifies the maximum amount of time in (non-negative) milliseconds that the server should use for working on a database
command. Defaults to 0, which disables this feature. Make sure this value is shorter than socket_timeout_ms.

Note: this will only be used for server versions 2.6 or greater, as that was when the $maxTimeMS meta-operator was
introduced.

You are strongly encouraged to set this variable if you know your environment has MongoDB 2.6 or later, as getting
a definitive error response from the server is vastly preferred over a getting a network socket timeout.

This may be set in a connection string with the maxTimeMS option.

#### `password`

If an "auth_mechanism" requires a password, this attribute will be used.  Otherwise, it will be ignored.

This may be provided in the connection string URI as a username:password pair in the leading portion of the authority
section before a @ character. For example, to authenticate as user "mulder" with password "trustno1":

    mongodb://mulder:trustno1@localhost If the username or password have a ":" or "@" in it, they must be URL encoded.
An empty password still requires a ":" character.

#### `port`

If a network port is not specified as part of the host attribute, this attribute provides the port to use. It defaults
to 27107.

#### `read_pref_mode`

The read preference mode determines which server types are candidates for a read operation. Valid values are:

    primary
    primaryPreferred
    secondary
    secondaryPreferred
    nearest

For core documentation on read preference see [http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/ <img
class='ext-link' src='/static/images/icons/window-new.svg' />](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/)

This may be set in a connection string with the readPreference option.

#### `read_pref_tag_sets`

The read_pref_tag_sets parameter is an ordered list of tag sets used to restrict the eligibility of servers, such as for
data center awareness. It must be an array reference of hash references.

The application of read_pref_tag_sets varies depending on the read_pref_mode parameter. If the read_pref_mode is
'primary', then read_pref_tag_sets must not be supplied.

For core documentation on read preference see [http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/ <img
class='ext-link' src='/static/images/icons/window-new.svg' />](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/)

This may be set in a connection string with the readPreferenceTags option. If given, the value must be key/value pairs
joined with a ":". Multiple pairs must be separated by a comma. If ": or "," appear in a key or value, they must be URL
encoded. The readPreferenceTags option may appear more than once, in which case each document will be added to the tag
set list.

#### `replica_set_name`

Specifies the replica set name to connect to. If this string is non-empty, then the topology is treated as a replica set
and all server replica set names must match this or they will be removed from the topology.

This may be set in a connection string with the replicaSet option.

#### `server_selection_timeout_ms`

This attribute specifies the amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a suitable server to be available for a read or
write operation. If no server is available within this time period, an exception will be thrown.

The default is 30,000 ms.

This may be set in a connection string with the serverSelectionTimeoutMS option.

#### `server_selection_try_once`

This attribute controls whether the client will make only a single attempt to find a suitable server for a read or write
operation. The default is true.

When true, the client will not use the server_selection_timeout_ms. Instead, if the topology information is stale and
needs to be checked or if no suitable server is available, the client will make a single scan of all known servers to
try to find a suitable one.

When false, the client will continually scan known servers until a suitable server is found or the
serverSelectionTimeoutMS is reached.

This may be set in a connection string with the serverSelectionTryOnce option.

#### `socket_check_interval_ms`

If a socket to a server has not been used in this many milliseconds, an ismaster command will be issued to check the
status of the server before issuing any reads or writes. Must be non-negative.

The default is 5,000 ms.

This may be set in a connection string with the socketCheckIntervalMS option.

#### `socket_timeout_ms`

This attribute specifies the amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a reply from the server before issuing a network
exception.

The default is 30,000 ms.

If set to a negative value, socket operations will block indefinitely until the server replies or until the operating
system TCP/IP stack gives up.

A zero value polls the socket for available data and is thus likely to fail except when talking to a local process (and
perhaps even then).

This may be set in a connection string with the socketTimeoutMS option.

#### `ssl`

This tells the driver that you are connecting to an SSL mongodb instance.

If SSL_ca_file is not provided, server certificates are verified against a default list of CAs, ie.
operating-system-specific default CA file. To disable verification, you can use SSL_verify_mode => 0x00.

You are strongly encouraged to use your own CA file for increased security.

Server hostnames are also validated against the CN name in the server certificate using SSL_verifycn_scheme => 'http'.
You can use the scheme 'none' to disable this check.

Disabling certificate or hostname verification is a security risk and is not recommended.

This may be set to the string 'true' or 'false' in a connection string with the ssl option, which will enable ssl with
default configuration. (A future version of the driver may support customizing ssl via the connection string.)

#### `username`

Optional username for this client connection. If this field is set, the client will attempt to authenticate when
connecting to servers. Depending on the "auth_mechanism", the "password" field or other attributes will need to be set
for authentication to succeed.

This may be provided in the connection string URI as a username:password pair in the leading portion of the authority
section before a @ character. For example, to authenticate as user "mulder" with password "trustno1":

    mongodb://mulder:trustno1@localhost If the username or password have a ":" or "@" in it, they must be URL encoded.
An empty password still requires a ":" character.

#### `w`

The client write concern.

- 0 Unacknowledged. MongoClient will NOT wait for an acknowledgment that the server has received and processed the
  request. Older documentation may refer to this as "fire-and-forget" mode. This option is not recommended.
- 1 Acknowledged. This is the default. MongoClient will wait until the primary MongoDB acknowledges the write.
- 2 Replica acknowledged. MongoClient will wait until at least two replicas (primary and one secondary) acknowledge the
  write.
You can set a higher number for more replicas. In MongoDB v2.0+, you can "tag" replica members. With "tagging" you can
specify a custom write concern For more information see Data Center Awareness.

This may be set in a connection string with the w option.

#### `wtimeout`

The number of milliseconds an operation should wait for w secondaries to replicate it.

Defaults to 1000 (1 second).

See w above for more information.

This may be set in a connection string with the wTimeoutMS option.

#### `read_concern_level`

The read concern level determines the consistency level required of data being read.

The default level is undef, which means the server will use its configured default.

If the level is set to "local", reads will return the latest data a server has locally.

Additional levels are storage engine specific. See Read Concern in the MongoDB
documentation for more details.

This may be set in a connection string with the the readConcernLevel option.

#### `query_timeout (DEPRECATED)`

This value is in milliseconds and defaults to 30000.

#### `timeout (DEPRECATED AND READ-ONLY)`

This option has been renamed as "connect_timeout_ms". If this option is set and that one is not, this will be used.

Connection timeout is in milliseconds. Defaults to 10000.

## Support & Maintenance Notice

MongoDB is maintained as part of the Clarive software contract. Patches and any service advisory to Mongo are
distributed as any other patches to the core Clarive Server and related products (like the ClaX agent) included in your
service agreement.

We do not support MongoDB with outside network access, such as having other users connecting to it with a database
client of any type.  Access to MongoDB must be restricted by either binding MongoDB to local cluster network controller
addresses, by firewall rules or a combination of both. By doing that, only the Clarive Server IP and its processes can
access the database network port. The configuration recommendation is described in our installation and configuration
guide for MongoDB. This is done not just as a best practice recommendation, but as a service clause: if you use the
MongoDB database outside of Clarive in any manner, that may limit our ability to support your installation and may void
any service guarantees.
