The Topic Grid is the list of Topics that the User can see.  Its concept is based on an email inbox.

The Topic Grid can be viewed within Clarive in three initial modes:

- **All Topics** - Opened by selecting the `All` menu option in the Topic menu.
- **By Category** - Opened by selecting a category under the Topic menu.
- **By Status** - Opened by selecting a status under the Topic menu.
- **By Project** - Opened by clicking on the Project name under `Projects` ![](/static/images/icons/project.svg) in the left pane.

### Sorting

By default the Topic Grid sorts by most recently modification date.

To change the sort direction, click on the Title of the desired column. Each click will reverse the sort direction
(ascending/descending).

#### Create Like

When you select one topic in the grid and then click the button Create Like, a new topic will appear filled with the
data of the previous one, but it needs to be saved to create it.

### Searching

The Topic Grid can be also filtered by using the Clarive [Search Syntax](/getting-started/search-syntax).

### Filtering

To filter which Topics are shown, use the right-side selector pane.

#### Statuses

Each Topic Status has three states:

- **Checked** - Show Topics with this status.
- **Crossed** - Hide Topics with this status.
- **Unselected** - Hide Topics with this status (if there is another Status checked) or show Topics with this Status (if
  there is no other Status checked).

Therefore, if no Status is checked or crossed, then all Statuses are shown.

##### Categories

Check the Topic Categories you want to see. If no Categories are selected, all Categories are displayed.

#### Reset Grid columns

Restore Topic Grid columns showing default columns and hiding those added by the user, using the `Reset Grid Columns`
button on the Action bar.

#### Export

Clarive allows the User to export the Topic Grid as HTML, CSV or YAML, using the `Export` button on the Action bar.

#### Open Kanban

Clicking on the `Open Kanban` button on the Action bar shows the Topics Grid in [Kanban view](/getting-started/kanban)

#### Collapsed Rows

Clicking on the `Collapse Rows` button on the Action bar allows viewing of more Topics per page, albeit with less
information.
