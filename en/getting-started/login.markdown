Before you can log in to Clarive, your [Clarive Administrator](/ee/admin/user) must add you as a User of Clarive. Your
Clarive Administrator will then notify you of your login information, which consists of:

- **Username** - The user created within the tool, by means of which you may log in to Clarive. The username is not
  case-sensitive.
- **Password** - Password generated by the administrator. The password is case-sensitive.

You can easily change your password by activating the User dropdown at the top right of the interface and selecting
*Change password*.

**Note**: Typically, Administrators will disable your password changing privileges when single sign-on or [LDAP/SAML
authentication](/ee/admin/ldap) is enabled.

### External Login

If you wish to log into Clarive directly from another website external to Clarive (from your company portal, for
example), you may use this HTML code as a template to create your login form:

```html
<textarea style="height: 250px; width: 90%">
    <form action="https://clariveserver:port/login" method="POST">
        <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <td>User Name:</td>
                <td>
                    <input type="text" name="username" />
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Password:</td>
                <td>
                    <input type="password" name="password" />
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">
                    <input type="submit" />
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </form>
</textarea>
```
