The User Preferences panel contains the default settings for your account login and session, as well as information that
dictates how Clarive and other Users may interact with you.

You can update your User Preferences at any time, including changing your session settings, your login information, and
your default workspace or project selection.

Your User Preferences settings override any settings that have been applied to the entire workspace.

Click your User name located in the top right corner of the Clarive interface and select the option `Preferences`.
