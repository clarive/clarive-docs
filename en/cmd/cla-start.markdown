It tries to start all systems Clarive needs to operate.

They are:

- *mongo*: Starts mongo server with configuration file located in `$CLARIVE_BASE/config/mongod.conf`.
- *nginx*: Start nginx server.
- *Clarive web server*: Web server started in daemon mode, options can be sent as arguments to the command to start web
  server in some way.
- *Clarive dispatcher*: Dispatcher server is started in daemon mode. Options can be sent as arguments to the command to
  start dispatcher server in some way.

This command supports some options. They are:

-  `--no_mongo`: To not start mongo server.
-  `--mongo_arbiter`: To start mongo arbiter server. It takes conf file from `$CLARIVE_BASE/conf/mongo-arb.conf`.

By default, this conf file is not installed in Clarive installation,  please consult mongo documentation to create this
conf file.
