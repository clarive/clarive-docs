All Clarive command-line interface (CLI) commands share a few commonalities.

## Getting help

To get help for a command, just write:

    cla help [command]

For a list of commands available, type:

    cla help

The list can vary according to the installed features and plugins.

## Passing options

Most options can be passed using command line arguments (sometimes called flags) preppended by double dash `--`.

For instance:

    --max_workers 20

In the command-line, options with underscore may be replaced with a dash `-`, so you could also write:

    --max-workers 30

**NOTE**: Although this is valid for the command-line options, it does not hold true for environment config files.

The value passed to the command-line option may be followed by an equal sign or separated by a space, so this is also
a valid format:

    --max_workers=30

## Config overwriting

The same command line options can be set in your environment config file `[env].yml`, by writing the option into your
config file:

```yaml
max_workers: 30
```
## Nested data as command-line options

It's also possible to assign values to nested keys through the command-line, by using a JSON-style attribute notation:

    --cache_config.expire_seconds 3000

Any dots `.` found in a command-line argument will be translated to nested value. In the case above, the `[env].yml`
equivalent would be:

```yaml
cache_config:
  expire_seconds: 3000
```

Another of doing this is to load a JSON-formatted string object into the command-line with the `--json` option:

    --json '{ cache_config: { expire_seconds: 3000 } }'

## Checking the loaded config

The final environment + command-line setup may be checked to see what values Clarive is finally loading by running the
command `cla config-show`

    cla config-show

Dumps a YAML representation of the current data.
