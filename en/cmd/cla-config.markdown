`cla config`:  Tool for generate a custom config file or display the config and opts parameters.

Running alone, this command *asks the user to generate a custom configuration file*
through a template.

This template can be defined:

- As an argument passed through the command line as following: `--template <template file>`.
- If no argument is passed, the template is located in `$CLARIVE_HOME/config/clarive.yml.template`.

After executing, it asks some questions about some configuration parameters, these are:

- `host` - Name of the instance that identifies the server.
- `web host` - Host added to published urls in emails.
- `web port` - Port added to published urls in emails and the interface.
- `site_key` - A random key used to encrypt passwords.
- `default theme`.
-  `time_zone_offset` - To establish time zone.

After answering all these questions a configuration file is created
in `$CLARIVE_HOME/config` directory. It is called:

- `<$env>.yml` -  If an option has been passed as an argument in the form: `-c <config_file>` .
- `<$CLARIVE_ENV>.yml.` - If no env argument is passed.

This command has three different subcommands that can be displayed through the help option:

        > cla help config

        usage: cla [-h] [-v] [--config file] command <command-args>

        Subcommands available for config (show all inherited config & options):
        config-show
        config-opts
        config-gen

        cla help <command> to get all subcommands.
        cla <command> -h for command options


`cla config-show`: this command shows all configuration parameters defined in
the following configuration files:

- `clarive.yml`.
- `global.yml`.

File defined in option `-c` passed as argument in the command call with yml
extension, or file `$CLARIVE_ENV` with yml extension.

With the option `--key <parameter>`, the output shows only the parameters
defined in <parameter> field.

`cla config-opts`: this command shows:

- All configuration parameters from the config files mentioned above.
- Some key configuration parameters from the environment.
- Arguments passed through command line.

`cla config-gen`: Same behavior as cla config.
