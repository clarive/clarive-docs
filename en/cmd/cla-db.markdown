`cla db`: Manage schemas in database.


### db-reindex

Reindexes all database tables, applying and updating the product recommended indexes again.

`--drop` - drops known (product) indexes before reindexing.

`--collection [name]` - limit reindex to just this collection name (ie. `topic`, `master`, etc.)

**WARNING**: a reindex can take anywhere from a few minutes to many hours, and may block access to the database in the
meanwhile.  So make sure to plan in advance for downtime.

### db-dump

Dumps a selection of collections from the MongoDB database using the `mongodump` utility.


The collections dumped do not hold large "blobs", it only includes things such as topics, CIs, and admin info. The
objective is to have a way of creating a quick dump to send to support that is not as big as a full database dump.

A local installation of a MongoDB client is needed for this command to work, and the `mongodump` command needs to be in
the path.

`--all` - dumps all collections instead, instead of just essential ones.
