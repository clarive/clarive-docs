This command offers options to support the Clarive plugin system.

All of the plugin commands, just like Clarive in general, is sensitive to the `--plugins-home` command-line option.

This option could be changed by configuration environment, so it's good to check what plugins are availble for a Clarive
installation by running the `plugin-list` command.

### cla plugin-new --plugin [plugin-id]

Bootstrap a new plugin, creating the placeholder folder structure for developing plugins.

You're are not required to run this program to develop plugins, it's just a good way to avoid having to create the
necessary files from zero.

    cla plugin-new --plugin myplugin

Will typically create the following plugin home folder:

    CLARIVE_BASE/plugins/myplugin/...

### cla plugin-test [partial-name-or-dir]

Tests plugins by running the test cases contained in each and every plugin `t` directory, more precisely
`CLARIVE_BASE/plugins/[plugin-id]/t`.

Test output is TAP-compatible (Test Anything Protocol), which make it compatible with severeal testing frameworks.

    ok 1

### cla plugin-list
