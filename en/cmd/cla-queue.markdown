`cla queue`: Queue management tools is performed through redis pub/sub implementation, so a redis server and a worker is
needed to run this command.

Without any option, it displays all workers registered.  It supports the option `–v`, display worker configuration.

Subcommands supported can be displayed with the help option:

        > cla help queue

        queue-pin
        queue-worker

        queue-key
        queue-flush

        cla help <command> to get all subcommands
        cla <command> -h for command options.

`cla queue-ping`: It needs the parameter`–wid <workerid>`: worker id for trying to ping worker.
