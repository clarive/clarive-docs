Clarive comes with native integration with the mainframe. Clarive is the ideal tool to implement an enterprise-wide
delivery cycle that does not leave behind the legacy systems.

### List of Mainframe Facilities Available

Here are the key mainframe integration points with Clarive:

- Build and Deployment of Z/OS artifacts stored in an open source code repository (i.e. Git or SVN).
- Build and Deployment of Z/OS artifacts stored in the Z/OS file system.
- Monitoring of deployment jobs.
- Chaining of deployment spool results.
- Parsing of spool log results for errors etc.

In addition, plan your implementation to get the most out of Clarive:

- Packaging, building and deployment of Z/OS programs is done by Clarive.
- Compile and link programs using JCL preprocessed templates. Deploy DB2 items directly to the database.
- Control each environment: Development, QA, Production, etc. Schedule jobs according to individualized release and
  availability calendars and windows.
- Request approval for critical deployment windows or sensitive applications or items.
- Keep the lifecycle in sync with external project and issue management applications.
- Run SQA on the changes promoted. Block deployment if a minimally reliable rollback changes in Production.

### Sending Files to Z/OS Partitions

The Clarive USS agent manages the shipping of files directly into Z/OS or USS (OMVS) partitions in the mainframe.

Clarive uses in-line JCL file wrapping to ship files using the FTP-JES mechanism.

### Identify Relationships â€“ Impact Analysis

Clarive can parse source code to determine what other programs need to be compiled when there is a change in an
artifact.

### Submit JCL from Templates

Define JCL templates in Clarive, then submit them as jobs into the Z/OS JES facility.

JCL templates can have variables that are defined for each environment, adding a great layer of flexibility to JCL
processing for implementing complex compile and deploy logic.

### Compile, Ship

Clarive JCLs can build and deploy just about any artifact that can be automated by a job card in the mainframe.

The spool system controls nesting, so that if a JCL sends another JOB for execution, Clarive will track this.

### Retrieving Job Spool Output

All jobs executed by Clarive are checked for errors and other results.

Clarive manages the spool log generated while running JCLs in the mainframe, by capturing and splitting its output so
that results can be easily read in each of its sections from Clarive's web interface.

### Character Translation Maps

Clarive can translate characters in both job cards and source code being sent from the Clarive server.

Use the `Sed Parser` op in the Clarive rule to implement translations as needed.

### REXX API

You can setup REXX on the mainframe to call into Clarive rules using our webservice API.

Here is an example of how a REXX calling into Clarive would look:

    /* REXX */ call claws '/rule/raw/is_release_ready', "api_key", "1234", "release_id", "r.2.3.4"

## Mainframe Requisites

There are only two requisites for mainframe compatibility with Clarive:

- FTP-JES facility enabled.
- Optionally, a USS/OMVS partition for the ClaX agent -- not needed to ship files, submit jobs, etc. only for special
  integrations.
- REXX, for calling Clarive rule webservices

### FTP-JES Interface

Before starting, ensure the following:

- Your Z/OS machine has the FTP server running.
- You have a suitably authorized user ID.
- In addition, you can use any of several configuration parameters to control the behavior of the JES interface,
  including the most important configuration parameter `JESINTERFACELEVEL`.

#### JES Interface Configuration Parameters

- `JESINTERFACELEVEL` - Specifies the level of function the JES interface provides. Set to 2 for maximum functionality.
- `JESENTRYLIMIT` - Limits how many jobs will be returned. The default is 200.
- `JESOWNER` - Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this owner. If blank, defaults to the current user.
- `JESJOBNAME` - Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this job name. If blank, defaults to the current user concatenated
  with an \*. Use \* to retrieve all jobs.
- `JESSTATUS` - Limits jobs retrieved to jobs with this status. If blank, defaults to all states. Valid states are
  OUTPUT, ACTIVE and INPUT.
