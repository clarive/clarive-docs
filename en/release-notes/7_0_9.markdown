## Clarive 7.0.9 Release Notes


**Release date**: 29 November 2017

We're pleased to present our new release Clarive 7.0.9.
This release contains a variety of fixes and improvements from 7.0.8.

### Highlights

- New settings menu
- Rulebook shell multiline
- Modify username and email in preferences
- Move artifacts menu from Tools to Deploy

#### New settings menu

We are working to improve Clarive UI and makes it more user-friedly to new users. First of all, we improve old Config
option in Admin menu. Now its called Settings and has a new interface.

This new design will allow users to see options clearly because we divided general configuration into sections.

#### Rulebook shell multiline

We know that Rulebooks is one of the best feature in Clarive so we are improving it to make more flexible and realible.
In this release we add multiline in `shell`command, so users now can do thinks like this:

```yaml
do:
    - shell: |
            ls -lart
            echo hello > hi.txt
            cat hi.txt
```

Or simpler:

```yaml
do:
    - |
      ls -lart
      echo hello > hi.txt
      cat hi.txt
```

#### Change username and email in Preferences

From Clarive team we knew the limitation that there was when a user wanted to change the username or email. Until now,
if a user wanted to change one of those values, only an Admin user could do it.

So now, in this new release we include in user preferences two new fields that allow users to change his username and
his email.

#### Move artifacts menu from Tools to Deploy

From Clarive we want make our product easy to use and friendlier without losing the essence of the product. That's why
we have been studying the consistency of the menus with the aim that the user has a clear idea of where are located each
of the options in the left menu.

To make this, we have removed Tools option in left panel and added Artifacts in Deploy menu.
