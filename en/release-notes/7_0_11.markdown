new features.

#### Docker Admin Interface

Local commands run in a shell in the Clarive server, always inside a Docker container. In this release,
we provide a new admin section to be able to manage Docker.

Containers placed in the same server than clarive can be manage. Complete list is shown including the current status of
each one

Using the new docker list containers you can do over them actions like start, stop and delete.

List of images are available too. Even you can delete Docker images using Clarive DevOps Docker Manager.

#### Secret Variables

Keep variables private. The content cannot be available anywhere, the clear view is not possible, Clarive allow know
define variables as **secret**.

Varibles have double scope. One of them is going to be available for environment/s and project/s defined in the own variable.
