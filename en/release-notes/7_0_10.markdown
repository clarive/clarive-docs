## Clarive 7.0.10 Release Notes


**Release date**: 5 December 2017

We're pleased to present our new release Clarive 7.0.10.
This release contains a variety of minor fixes and improvements from 7.0.9. Also we include two awesome
new features.

### Highlights

- Kanban custom swimlanes
- User Interface enhancements

#### Kanban custom swimlanes

Clarive DevOps Kanban is one of the most useful that we ever work with. Even so, we continue working on it to
provide new features that facilitate its use. In this release we include a substantial improvement to show
the information, you can create and *customize your own swimlanes*.

!!! note
    Custom swimlanes can be defined only by the Kanban owner. Contact him if other
    one is useful in your workday

You can select the fields that you want to use as swimlane and even select the values that can be use as lane in
the Kanban board.

A new type of swimlane that we introduce in 7.0.10 Clarive release is **parent topic release**.

Thus, you can take a look what features are include in each release only in one Kanban board. Of course, you can
filter according your preferences in swimlane mode.

In all swimlanes you can move topics from one lane to another if it's allow. This will update topic relation automatically.

!!! tip
    Kanban view with parent topic swimlane can allow you move topics from one
    Sprint/Release to another one easily.


#### User Interface enhancements

We know how important the user experience is, that's why during this week focus on improve Clarive interface. We've done
small changes like increase menu paddings, some buttons redesign. But our greatest effor in UI has gone to two screens: Monitor
and Topic grid

**Monitor** is the screen where you can find together the relations between code, topics and deployments to environments.

With lane menu we simplify the way that you can perform with each job and get the information related too.

Job statuses are colorful in order to distinguish what is the current status or your deployment. All our job filters are
still available in the toolbar

!!! info
    Click on job or go to ![](/static/images/icons/deploy.svg "Deploy") (Deploy) to have a look to job dashboard. See full job log
    clicking on ![](/static/images/icons/job-full-log.svg "Log") (Log) .

In **Topic Grid** we reduce our toolbar, moving under more options menu (vertical ellipses) grid actions non-related
with display mode.

As in monitor we want you to be able to related deployments and topics, so we include new column that help you to
know what is the current status

Each ball talks you about something different. **"MR"** is *Merge Request*, **"CI/CD"** means
*Continuous Integration/Deployment*, and **"NB"** refers to *Nightly Build*
