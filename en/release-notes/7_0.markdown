### Continuous Integration

Push to a branch and Clarive will kick-off your CI build and test pipelines.
You can use global pipelines and predefined natures so that you don’t have to write
a pipeline for every new project.

### Every Issue is now a Topic

Topics make it simpler to manage your project: branches are 1:1 with their corresponding topic (Feature,
User Story, Bugfix, etc.) making them true topic branches.

### Kanban boards

Clarive’s powerful kanban boards help you quickly visualize your topics in any arrangement. Boards
can be personalized or used by the team.

### Multi-Project Releases
Releases can group changes from more than one project at the same time. This makes it easier to manage complex
releases with many teams working at once.

### Built-in Workflow Engine

Topics have statuses like In Progress, Ready, Frozen, etc. You can customize workflows for better
control when and where to move your topics from and to and who can do it (EE only)

### Docker under the hood
All CI/CD runs in a Docker service in the Clarive server or as part of your swarm.

### Custom Fields
Kanban topics can be grouped into any lists, so that you can bisect your project in many ways.
