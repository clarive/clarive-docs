The Clarive *Rule Designer* is the interface for designing, prototyping, writing and testing Clarive rules.

### Rule Types

There are many types of rules that can be created using the Rule Designer.  These are the available rule types:

- Independent
- Webservice
- Event
- Job Pipeline
- Form
- Workflow
- Dashboard
- Report
- Blueprint

#### Independent Rule

An independent rule is a rule that is meant to be either included in another rule, or used in conjunction with another
entity in Clarive.  Independent rules are used for anything that does not justify having a rule type of its own.

- Catalog Task automation entails independent rules.
- Scheduled rules are independent rules.
- Talkback responses are done by independent rules.
