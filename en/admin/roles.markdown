Security within Clarive is handled through a [role system](/concepts/roles).

All access to administrator functions and user functions is defined through roles. Users are thus assigned one or more
roles. That way, the userâ€™s access to Clarive is limited and controlled.

**Example**

An *Administrator* role can be defined and all privileges can be set on administrator functionality within the tool,
such as [Category Administration](/admin/categories), [Notifications Administration](/admin/notifications), [Scheduler
Access](/admin/scheduler), [User Administration](/admin/user), etc. A role *incident manager* can be defined with full
access to the topic category *Incident* but will for instance have no access to topic category *release*, since this
topic category will be managed by the role of *Release manager*.

A user will be assigned one or more roles, and thus inherit the access to the topics he or she can work on.

Role administration can be performed by selecting Admin - ![](/static/images/icons/role.svg) Roles from the menu bar.
This will display all the currently available roles in a list view.

The list view contains the following columns:

- `Role` - The name of the Role.
- `Description` - The description of the role.
- `Mailbox` - The mailbox specific to the role, for [notification](/admin/notifications) purposes.
- `Options` - Summary of all Role actions for this Role.


## Role List Options


## ![](/static/images/icons/add.svg) Create

A new window is opened by clicking on `Create`, in which the following information needs to be provided for
configuration:

- **Role Name** - The name of the Role e.g. *developer*, *release manager*, *change manager*.
- **Description** - A longer description of the Role.
- **Dashboard** - Clarive has several [dashboards](/concepts/dashboards). Dashboards may be associated here with roles,
  such that in [user preferences](/getting-started/prefs) only those dashboards associated with those roles will appear.
The first dashboard to be added will be the default dashboard. Each user may change his or her default dashboard in user
preferences.


### Available Actions

Highlight the user and click `Edit`. All Available Actions attributed to the role are displayed in the left pane.
A Group of actions or a specific action can be added by selecting and dragging the group Action from the left pane to
the right pane.

- `Remove Selection` ![](/static/images/icons/delete-grid-row.svg) - Removes the currently selected Action from
  the Role.
- `Remove All` ![](/static/images/icons/delete-grid-all-rows.svg) - Removes all selections.


## Users that have a Role

Select the *Users* tab to see the users that have the current Role and in which [scope](/concepts/scope) they have the
Role assigned to.

## Scopes where the Role is assigned

This a pivoted version of the User list. Now you see which users have the current Role.
