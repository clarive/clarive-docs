The Calendaring administration interface allows administrators to setup when jobs can be scheduled depending on job
scope and contents.

A `Calendar` is a set of weekly (7 days) slots that go from 12am to 11:59pm (00:00h to 23:59h).

A `Calendar Slot` or `Slot` is the block formed by a start time, end time, slot type and either a given weekday or
specific date.

### Calendar List

This contains the list of calendars that have been configured.

To create a new calendar, select `Create`.

- `Calendar Name` - name of the calendar being created.
- `Description` - a brief description (optional).
- `Precedence` - set the precedence this calendar has over others when several calendars converge. The higher the
  precedence, the better.
- `Creation Mode` - either creates the calendar with an empty list of slots (`Create as New`) or as a copy of another
  calendar slots ( `Create as Copy`)
- `Environment` - the environment the calendar applies to
- `Scope` - the scope of the calendar, either only for a specific Project, or for any other scope in the system.

### Editing a Calendar

In edit mode, you can setup the calendar slots and change the main properties of the calendar, such as precedence or
scope.

#### Adding a weekly slot

To add a weekly slot, ie. one that will repeat everyday, just select the block from `00:00` to `23:59` by clicking on
it.

The slot edit window, `Edit Calendar Slot`, will open up:

- `Weekday` - the weekday selected
- `Type` - the type of slot, `Normal`, `Urgent` or `No Job`
- `Starts at` - time ends will start
- `Ends at` - time slot ends

If slots of the same type are created next to each other, they will be automatically merged.

**NOTE**: the slots are saved immediately, so there's no cancel button available.

#### Normal Slot

The normal slot means jobs can be schedule by anyone with a role that has the `Create Job` action.

#### Urgent Slot

The urgent slot means users with `Create Job` action can also schedule, but the job will be marked as `Urgent`.

The effect selecting a `Urgent` calendar slot on a job has to be defined in the job pipeline rule. Typically, it will be
rule logic as following:

    IF job IS URGENT Request Approval

At the end of the `PRE` step.

#### Empty Slots

`Empty` slots mean they'll be overwritten by any other slot that's set by another calendar with higher or lower
precedence.

#### No Job

The `No Job` slot prevents lower precedence slots from enabling `Normal` or `Urgent` slots. Use `No Job` instead of just
`Empty` to create a higher precedence slot that prevents job creation at specific times.

#### Active / Inactive Slots

Slots can be created or modified into an "inactive" state.  The effect of an inactive slot is that it behaves as it did
not existed. This behavior will last until the slot is activated again.

This is useful for situations where the slot is temporarily inactive (ie. due to maintenance), but deleting the slot
would result in losing the information that was already defined.

### Date-Specific Slots

Date-specific slots are slots that only occur at one, non-recurring date in time.

To create a date-specific slot, select the `new slot mm/dd/yyyy` link in the bottom of the slot editor. Use the calendar
widget on the right to navigate to the week where the slot is defined.
