Rule Test Sets allows to run the rule on different data sets. Those sets can be saved for later use to verify the
integrity of the rule.

Test sets produce not only the output but also the resulting stash for easy debugging.

To see this option just click on `Run` in a [rule](/ee/rules/rule-concepts).
