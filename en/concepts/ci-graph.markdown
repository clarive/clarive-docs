This displays a *Graph* on the [Resource](/concepts/resource).

### Viewing a Resource's CI Graph

Click on `Show CI Graph` to open a tab for displaying the Resource relationships in a variety of graph formats in
relation to other [Resources](/concepts/resource), such as Project, User, Topic etc.

The default is *Space Tree*, which renders the Topic as a linear-type graph, although you may toggle between this and
other formats by alternately clicking `RGraph`, `d3G` and `Space Tree`. *RGraph* displays the various branches radiating
out amnd intersecting within a series of concentric circles. *d3G*, in turn, shows the different Resources as points,
connected by curved arrows.

**Generate Image** - This feature, common to all three graph types, allows an image to be created from the generated
graph.

Re-opening the *Show CI Graph* tab restores the default format.
