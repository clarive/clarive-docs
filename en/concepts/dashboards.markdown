*Dashboards* represent a fundamental role in the proper use of Clarive.

They can represent the position of the tool, so that it can display a large amount of information in one place.

To do this, the Dashboards are created by Dashboard type rules in order to add, edit or remove components called
*dashlets*.

Dashlets can represent information differently. You can add calendars, tables showing Topics that are in a specific
state, project graphs etc.

All these components form a Dashboard-type [Rule](/concepts/rule) which can then be used by [Roles](/concepts/roles).

The end view is a window where all *dashlets* included in the rule to show what the user needs to appear.

All users can add, edit or delete dashboard items clicking in ![](/static/images/icons/resize.svg) Rearrange button.
This activate edition mode that allow to the user to add new dashlets ![](/static/images/icons/add.svg), resize
dashlets, change dashlet order or remove dashlets ![](/static/images/icons/delete.svg).

The users can save their own dashboard clicking in ![](/static/images/icons/save.svg) Save as. Clarive will indentify it
with a new icon ![](/static/images/icons/dashboard-user.svg).
