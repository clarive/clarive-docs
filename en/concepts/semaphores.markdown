Semaphores are labels that identify critical
regions in rules so that they do not execute concurrently.

They are used in rules and rulebooks to protect sensitive resources
from being handled simultaneously by limiting their availabily.

Read how to monitor them in the [Semaphores](/ee/admin/semaphores) administration panel.
