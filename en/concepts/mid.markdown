The *MID* is short for *Master ID*.

This is an internal counter used to uniquely identify [Resources](/concepts/resource) in Clarive, including
[Topics](/concepts/topic), Servers, [Users](/ee/admin/user), [Projects](/concepts/project), [Statuses](/concepts/status),
etc.

As has been commented, MIDs are unique per installation or creation and usually show up in the Clarive UI prepended by
a hash sign:

         #3422
