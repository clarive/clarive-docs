The term *Resource* refers to the fundamental structural unit of a configuration management system. Clarive is such
a configuration management system, keeping track of all its configuration entities as Resources in its database.

In Clarive, examples of Resources can be [Topics](/concepts/topic) (i.e. releases, changesets, requirements, test cases
etc.), servers, User IDs, agents, middleware (such as JBoss or Apache), cloud instances, mainframe nodes etc.

Clarive oversees the life of the Resources through a combination of processes and tools by implementing and enabling the
fundamental elements of security, change management and audits.

Any activity over Resources (create, update and delete) is registered and is displayed in a Resources grid.

Every Resource has its unique Master ID ([MID](/concepts/mid)) in Clarive.
