A *Rerun* is when a [Job](/concepts/job) step is executed again.  This is usually necessary when a Job step has failed
for some reason.

When selecting the POST step, we have the possibility of changing the previous [Status](/concepts/status) of the Job if
we wish. When selecting the option *Change Job Status*, two possible options are available: OK and FAIL, indicating the
final Status of the previous Job execution.
