YAML is a human-readable markup format used for data serialization.

YAML is a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language".

The following is an example of a YAML from Clarive (from a Project [Resource](/concepts/resource)):

```yaml
    ---
    active: 1
    assets: []
    created_by: root
    description: ''
    folders:
    -
      active: '1'

      description: 'another repository'
      exclude: []
      include: []

      SPECIAL:

```

YAML is used extensively in Clarive because it allows for expressing data
contents in a human-readable format that is familiar to the technical user.

YAML is also used because it allows the system to version data contents,
specially Resources, in a file system.

Also, you can play with YAML in Clarive's [REPL](/devel/repl) or at this
online tool:

### Indentation

In YAML indentation is important, YAML uses a fixed indentation scheme which
represents different relationship between elements.

```yaml
parent:
   child:
      grandchild: 10
```

In JavaScript, the above maps to the following Object:

```json
{ parent: { child: { grandchild: 10 } } }
```

In Clarive, indentation requires at least 1 space.

### Colons

Colons represent key-value pairs, which are used to define Objects
(Hashes or Dictionaries in other languages).

```yaml
key1: value1
key2: value2
```

Which in JavaScript translates to:

```js
{ key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' }
```

### Dashes

Dashes are used for creating lists, or Arrays in Javascript.

```yaml
parent:
   - child1
   - child2
```

In JavaScript, the above maps to the following Object:

```json
{ parent: [ 'child1', 'child2' ] }
```

### Multi-line data

Multi-line strings can be written using the `|` (pipe) YAML operator. Indentation
is necessary, so use leading spaces.

```yaml
mytext: |
  Long, long,
  multiline text that is
  nicely indented everywhere
  and may start with spaces.
age: 20
```
