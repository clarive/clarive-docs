In Clarive it is possible to view the *Lifecycle* of a [Topic](/concepts/topic) as a graphical display.

### Viewing a Topic's Lifecycle

Click `Open life cycle` (located to the top right-hand side of the tab). This displays the *Plain* mode of the Topic
Lifecycle as default. Here the entire Lifecycle is shown, regardless of Role. Roles are, by default, not marked in this
view, although labels may be added by clicking on `Options` and selecting *With Labels* from the dropdown list. In
*Options* you may also select *icons* and/or *color* as visual aids.

Alternatively, click `Role` to view the Lifecycle in *Role* mode, which displays the various Roles in a series of boxes,
which contain the parts of the Lifecycle pertinent to each respective Role. The `Options` button is also available in
this mode.

Click on `Plain` to return to *Plain* mode.

The *Overview* pane allows you to bring into view parts of the Lifecycle (in either mode) that are off-screen. Click
into this pane and move the cursor to into view the relevant part of the Lifecycle in the main pane. You may also use
`Zoom -` and `Zoom +` as appropriate. These functions are available in both *Plain* and *Role* modes. You may also click
in the main pane and move the cursor around to navigate.
