Clarive *Roles* are somewhat similar to groups, the main difference being that group membership is global, whereas
[Project](/concepts/project) Role membership is Project-specific.

Additionally, group membership can only be altered by Clarive administrators, whereas Project Role membership can be
altered by Project administrators.
